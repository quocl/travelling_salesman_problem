Usage:
	make	run

By default, the population size is 10, the number of generations is 100 and the evolution technique is permutation.
To change the population size, number of generations and the evolution technique to, let say 100, 100 and crossover, respectively, run:
	make  run POP=100  GEN=100	TECH=1
